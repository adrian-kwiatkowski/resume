# About me

My name is Adrian and I am an iOS Developer with ~5 years of experience. During this time I have worked on a number of projects from within different business areas (mainly shopping, social, utility and telecom apps). I have been a fan of Apple products for as long as I can remember.

At work, I am professional and pay attention to details. I am a well-organized person that enjoys working individually, but is far more excited about being a part of a team with people who like to get things done in the most effective and simple way. I love modern, minimalistic design and good User Experience. 

My commercial iOS Development journey has started in a company that manages the largest shopping/coupon apps in Poland and there I gained experience working with large scale apps (100k+ MAU). During that time I also learned how to work with e.g. Firebase, Realm, fastlane. Also, this was the time when I got to know how to work in Scrum and Kanban. Then, for around 1,5 years I was working in a software house and learned basics of reactive programming (RxSwift) and also expanded my skills in application architecture.

In the beginning of 2021, I moved to Copenhagen and started working in Jayway on the GN Kai project - a companion app that helps onboard people to a new experience of using hearing aid. This app was written entirely using Apple's new UI framework - SwiftUI. Later that year I joined Jabra Sound+ team where I learned the basics of the new Swift Concurrency framework (async await).

Personally, I am a very friendly and conflict-free person. I also love the eco-friendly, zero waste lifestyle, a mindfulness approach and all kinds of animals - I have a cat.

<br>

## Obostrzenia

The app was supposed to show what are the current governmental restrictions (caused by COVID-19 pandemic) in Poland, based on user's location. Together with my friend, we wrote the **MVP** in **Flutter** and submitted it to the App Store and Google Play.

Unfortunately - due to the fact that this was a personal project rather than a one from a recognized institution, such as a governmental entity or hospital - it got rejected, so we decided to abandon the project.

What I've learned:

- writing simple apps using **Flutter**
- **geolocator** to fetch user's location data
- **permission_handler** to work with user's permissions

## [HiHi Connect 2](https://apps.apple.com/app/hihi-connect-2/id1532249807)

Application that allows audio and video calling using **Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)**. Users can also store contacts, synchronize them and view their presence (using **XMPP**).

For the first few months of this project I was the only iOS Developer, so I had a chance to find out about the responsibilities and problems that come with such role.

What I've learned:

- integrating **PushKit** into the project to receive VoIP notifications
- working with **CallKit** to handle CXActions
- **Contacts Framework** to access and display contacts stored on the device
- **CoreData** to store and synchronize data fetched from the API (company contacts, calls history)

## Social networking App

This project was a social network app that allows users to search for groups related to their interests/hobbies and post text, images, videos and links based on their permissions/group access.

What I've learned:

- unidirectional data flow using **Moya**, **Realm** and **RxSwift**
- writing **unit tests** with **Quick** and **Nimble**
- basics of **AVFoundation** to play video

## [Zdrowe Zakupy](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/zdrowe-zakupy/id1200020785#?platform=iphone)

Zdrowe Zakupy is an application that helps you buy products that do not contain harmful ingredients. After scanning the product's barcode, you can check the specific ingredients and their possible harmfulness.

This was my first chance to work on a project from beginning to launch. Even though it was an app with an established userbase, we decided to start this one from scratch due to the loads of bugs in the legacy code.

What I've learned:

- writing **unit tests** in **XCTest**
- scanning barcodes using **AVCaptureMetadataOutput**
- implementing **Rewarded Video Ads**
- the process of submitting a new app to the **App Store**

<br>

## [Qpony](https://apps.apple.com/app/qpony-promocje-kupony-zniżki/id585176404#?platform=iphone)

</p>

<br>

## [Blix](https://apps.apple.com/app/blix-gazetki-lista-zakupów/id1012288672#?platform=iphone)

Blix is a free application with leaflets of the most popular retail chains in Poland and a convenient and simple shopping list. Additionally, thanks to the intelligent product search engine, you can check where you can buy the cheapest product.

This app was a particular challenge, as due to the high MAU (100k+), every new update was a critical moment to make sure that all parts of the app are backwards compatible.

What I've learned:

- **MVC** architecture
- using **Realm** to store and migrate data
- working with **deeplinks** and **Branch.io**
- creating simple lanes with **fastlane**

<br>

## Skidki i Akcii

Skidki i Akcii is a free application that was created to simplify users life and help to get rid of the long search for discounts in supermarkets, leaflets and on the Internet.

As my first commercial project, I got a task to create it as a clone of the other app described above (Blix), but for the ukrainian market. It was a very didactic project for me as I had a chance to get to know how large projects are structured and how to work with applications this size.

What I've learned:

- writing commercial apps with **Swift**
- becoming more familiar with **Xcode** and **iOS SDK**
- working with advanced **Auto Layout** and **UIKit**
- implementing **Google Ads**
